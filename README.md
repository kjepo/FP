# FP

This is a interpreter for John Backus' FP language, more or less as described
in his ACM Turing Award article
"Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs"
 [https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/359576.359579]

I wrote this as a grad student and recently brought it back to life by
replacing `malloc.h` with `stdlib.h`.

It executes the test suite `test_suite.fp`.  I also started on a Scheme interpreter, `scm.fp`,
but it is not complete.
